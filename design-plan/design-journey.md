# Project 3: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.** Refine all sections before the final submission.

You are graded on your design process. If you later need to update your plan, **do not delete the original plan, rather leave it in place and append your new plan _below_ the original.** Then explain why you are changing your plan. Any time you update your plan, you're documenting your design process!

**Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Design Plan (Milestone 1)

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class (includes the design prerequisite for this course).**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality.


### Catalog (Milestone 1)
> What will your catalog website be about? (1 sentence)

My website will be a site on adopting cats.


### _Consumer_ Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's _consumer_ audience. Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific. (1 sentence)
> Justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

My sites consumers will be animal lovers, families, cat ladies, etc. They are looking to find a cat that will be right for their family.

This is a cohesive audience because they all are coming the site for the same purpose. They want a site where they can explore different types, colors, or breed of cats. My site will allow them to do that and adopt them.


### _Consumer_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your _consumer_ audience's goals for using this catalog website.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1. But probably not more than 3.)
> **Hint:** Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and insert new entries into the catalog. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.

Goal 1: Explore different cat varieties

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will make it easy to filter and look up certain cats. I also want to implement a search system that will allow them to search up cat breeds or a certain cat they have seen before.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - this will make it easier for my audience to explore the website. There are many different type of cats, there needs to be a filtering system in case the audience has a specific cat in mind.

Goal 2: Ability to adopt cat

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will make a detailed page on each cat
  - I will list there name, age, breed, etc
  - I will also make a submit form button that will allow them to adopt the cat. They will recieve a submission email/message after they adopt the cat
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - If the audience want to learn more about the cat, there should be a more in depth page on the cat. There should also be an adoption button so they can actually adopt the cat.


### _Consumer_ Audience Device (Milestone 1)
> How will your _consumer_ audience access this website? From a narrow (phone) or wide (laptop) device?
> Justify your decision. (1 sentence)

Laptop

I will use a laptop so the audience can better look at the cats. Having a mobile screen will make it hard for the cats to all display together.


### _Consumer_ Persona (Milestone 1)
> Use the goals you identified above to develop a persona of your site's _consumer_ audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.

![Persona Bobbia](images/Bobbia.png)

Bobbia

**Factors that Influence Behavior:**

- cost of cat
- what type of cat there is
- if cat is potty trained

### _Administrator_ Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain your site's _administrator_ audience. Your audience should be specific, but not arbitrarily specific. (1 sentence)
> Justify why this audience is a **cohesive** group. (1-2 sentences)

The adminstrators audience will be people who run the adoption agency, Such as employees who need to update the website when there is a new cat up for adoption.

this is a cohesive audience because they all have the same goals. They want to update the catalog and edit the descriptions for each of the cats.


### _Administrator_ Audience Goals (Milestone 1)
> Document your _administrator_ audience's goals for using this catalog website.
> List each goal below. There is no specific number of goals required for this, but you need enough to do the job (Hint: It's more than 1. But probably not more than 3.)
> **Hint:** Users will be able to view all entries in the catalog and insert new entries into the catalog. The audience's goals should probably relate to these activities.

Goal 1: Update information on the website

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - I will add an option where the employee can update the description of cats
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - This will be useful in case wrong information is uploaded about one of the cats. They have to be able to quickly edit the website.

Goal 2: Add/remove a cat to the system

- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those goals in your design?_
  - There will a add/delete button for the cats.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - This will make it easier for the administer to add/remove cats since there's an easily accessible button.



### _Administrator_ Persona (Milestone 1)
> Use the goals you identified above to develop a persona of your site's _administrator_ audience.
> Your persona must have a name and a face. The face can be a photo of a face or a drawing, etc.

![Persona Robbia](images/Robbia.png)

Robbia

**Factors that Influence Behavior:**

- how easy it is to update cat info
- they want to go home quickly, so they want to finish work quickly

**Goals:**

- finish job on time
- update the cat information
- add/remove cats to the website

**Obstacles:**

- They have a time constraint. They could only work for so long during the day
- Is an old man ignorant to technology. Websites have to be very easy and simple to use for him to understand

**Desires:**

- Ability to add/remove cats easily
- Ability to update website
- Log in to his account easily


### Catalog Data (Milestone 1)
> Using your personas, identify the data you need to include in the catalog for your site's audiences.
> Justify why this data aligns with your persona's goals. (1 sentence)

- cat pictures
- Cat names
- cat breed
- cat age
- cat description/characteristics
- Cat health
- cat gender
- How far away they are

This aligns with Bobbias goals because they need all this information if they want to adopt a cat. Some users have certain preferences, so the website needs to offer a lot of information.



### Site Design (Milestone 1)
> Design your catalog website to address the goals of your personas.
> Sketch your site's design:
>
> - These are **design** sketches, not _planning_ sketches.
> - Use text in the sketches to help us understand your design.
> - Where the content of the text is unimportant, you may use squiggly lines for text.
> - **Do not label HTML elements or annotate CSS classes.** This is not a planning sketch.
>
> Provide a brief explanation _underneath_ each sketch. (1 sentence)
> **Refer to your persona by name in each explanation.**

![Home page](images/Cathomepage.png)
Name of website will be "Furrytail Endings", It will be captioned "find your happily ever after with a furry frined". It will be cute and display many pastel colors. I wanted it to be friendly and comfortable yet professional
![Info cat page](images/CatInfoPage.png)
Information on the cat w images. will have a form at the bottom to adopt the cat.
![Administration page](images/AdministrationPage.png)
Button to remove and add cat. Once you click them, you will be linked to a form on what cat to upload.


I changed my design slightly, I decided to move the filter since there were only 4 adjustable tags. I opted for a horizontal bar since it aligns with industy standards. Additionally I made my background purple. However these are minor changes where I just changed the color and moved some functionality around.


### Catalog Design Patterns (Milestone 1)
> Explain how you used design patterns in your site's design. (1-2 sentences)

I implemented common design patterns while giving it my own creative touch. I put the title at the very top. Additionally, traditonally, log-in button are on the top right. I also put a search bar at the top and a filter on the left side since it is an industry standard. I also made sure everything was aligned and followed the users eyes.


## Implementation Plan (Milestone 1, Milestone 2, Milestone 3, Final Submission)

### Database Schema (Milestone 1)
> Plan the structure of your database. You may use words or a picture.
> A bulleted list is probably the simplest way to do this.
> Make sure you include constraints for each field.

- id  INT (NN, A, PK, U),
- name TEXT (NN),
- desciption TEXT ()

Table: tag
- id
- type
- value

TABLe : cat tags
